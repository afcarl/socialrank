socialrank
==========

My submission for the Pennapps 2013 hackathon. SocialRank is a news aggregator which combines Facebook's social media power &amp; relevancy with Reddit's famous hotness algorithm. The titles update in real time. The news crawler in this project is subpar because we had 1.5 days of time for the content and the point was not about the volume of news but how they were organized. Check out my other project, Wintria, if you'd to see a news search engine which i'm working on at the moment as a startup.
